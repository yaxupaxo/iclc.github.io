We are accepting submissions for the following:

* Long papers (6-12 pages)
* Short papers (4-6 pages)
* Poster/demo papers (2-4 pages)
* Performances (1-2 page abstract, plus technical rider)

All submissions must use the conference template and follow the
instructions within, available in both Microsoft Word and Markdown
formats. Download the [latest version
here](https://github.com/livecodenetwork/templates/archive/master.zip),
as a zipfile.

All submissions must be in PDF format, and submitted via Easychair.

ICLC is an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches
are encouraged and we recognise that the appropriate length of a paper
may vary considerably depending on the approach. However, all
submissions must propose an original contribution to Live Coding
research, cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research
methods.

The proceedings will be published with ISSN, and there will also be an
follow-on opportunity to contribute to a special issue of the Journal
on Performance Arts and Digital Media; details will be announced soon.
